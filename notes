    divide list of drugs by that many and write to temp files
    run each job and pass list of drugs to each

SCRIPTS 3 (bash + python)
    multiprocess x20
    split number of drugs by number of processes
    in each process

        load in full drug list
        get comparisons
        run comparisons
        write results
